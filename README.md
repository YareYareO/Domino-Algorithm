# DominoAlgorithm

A small console app to find the most direct path in a given map (map.jpg).

The algorithm uses breadth-first search and backtracking.

I used a similar algorithm in my comino project, which i plan to revive again. In its current state i do not expect it to work.

This works tho, have fun. The only updates i want to make are performance related, and maybe being able to use different maps or atleast make the current map bigger.
